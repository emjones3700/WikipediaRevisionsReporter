## Challenge #1 Complete

In the Guice config class QueryEngineModule, I changed the binding from FakeQueryEngine.class to WikipediaQueryEngine.class

## Challenge #2 Complete

I started by making a generic Formatter interface that is implemented by the original RevisionFormatter and my added NewAndImprovedRevisionFormatter. In my new formatter, I 
revise the DateTimeFormatter to show non-military time and ISO dates for a better user experience.

## Challenge #3 Complete
To make the string in one line, I used the reduce function in Java's Steam API to append the results.

## Reflection Question #2: Polymorphism and Dependency Inversion
